# YATM Clusters

Handles all the registration logic for node clusters.

A node cluster is a group of nodes that may be interconnected in some way, either physically or virtually.

These nodes are updated as a group vs individually where possible.

YATM Clusters handles the registration, maintenance and updates for these clusters.
