# YATM

YATM - Yet Another Tech Mod.

While YATM was originally made as a minecraft mod, I never did enjoy working in Java, so I ported the (incomplete) mod over to minetest and lived happily ever after.

Check each mod for it's own README on what it does.

## Tests

You may notice a tests/ directory in some of the mod directories, this uses the 'Luna' test module that I originally wrote for a love2d game ported over to minetest (along with the Class module).

It's a rather simple unit test framework that runs during startup, for now tests run on startup, and usually complete within milliseconds, but this will be toggable later.
