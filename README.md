# YATM

YATM - Yet Another Tech Mod.

While YATM was originally made as a minecraft mod, I never did enjoy working in Java, so I ported the (incomplete) mod over to minetest and lived happily ever after.

## What does it do?

As someone who lacks the ability to focus on one specific topic, it does everything I want it to.

* Machines that do mundane tasks. CHECK
* Random magic elements that don't really make sense in a tech mod? CHECK
* Random farming related stuff? CHECK
* Experimental code? CHECK

## So, what's in the pack?

For now:

__yatm_bees__

A simple bee keeping module, based off Growthcraft's Bees.

__yatm_cables__

Provides various cables, pipes and connections between YATM devices.

__yatm_core__

Base mod

__yatm_decor__

Decoration blocks

__yatm_machines__

Where a bulk of the machines are

__yatm_oku__

OKU - Octet Kompute Unit, a experimental 8-bit cpu mod, I'm still looking at different cpu architectures, so this may take time for it materializes.

__yatm_rails__

I don't think I like the existing 'train' mods, from an aesthetic (no offense to the authors, it's not my style that's all.), so I intend to roll my own.

__yatm_reactors__

Just some basic nuclear stuff, loosely based on Big Reactors from minecraft.

## Your own energy system?

Yes, from what I've seen there isn't really a formal energy system like with minecraft (i.e. RF being defacto minimum for most tech mods).

Besides YATM works slightly different than your traditional tech mod.

## Your own fluids system?

Yes, for now, until I decide to toss the code and just use fluidlib.
