__void__ related to storage

## Notes

Difference between a `void crate` and a `void chest`

A `void crate` is a dense storage unit and cannot be accessed directly, it has a storage capacity greater than the void chest.

On the other hand the `void chest` can be accessed directly (i.e. to install a storage unit and check it's contents), but it's capacity is vastly smaller.
