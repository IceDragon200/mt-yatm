# YATM Fluids

Fluids adds the fluid system, fluid tanks and various utility modules for dealing with fluids in YATM.

This differs from [fluid_lib](https://gitlab.icynet.eu/evert/fluid_lib), nodes add support for fluid interfacing, by... adding a fluid_interface!

Check the fluid_interface.lua for the various default implementations available.
